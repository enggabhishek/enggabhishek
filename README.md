| https://github.com/enggabhishek/Out-of-Pattern-Detection | Developed and deployed predictive models to detect anomalies in 16 GB of HTTP request log data, enhancing Docdigitizer's cybersecurity. Tasks included building Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2, setting up Managed Identities in Azure, configuring Apache Kafka Client, ElasticSearch Cloud for OLAP, and Apache Airflow DAG on the Astronomer platform. Additionally, data extraction, cleaning, feature engineering, and streaming to ElasticSearch Cloud were performed. Kibana dashboards were set up, along with creating Azure Function Apps and Data Factory Pipelines to trigger Airflow DAGs. GitHub Repository and Git Actions were established for CI/CD deployment. The models achieved 93% accuracy in load factor estimation and anomaly detection. |

| https://github.com/enggabhishek/NYC-Taxi-Trip-Data-Analysis| Using Python, Hadoop, PySpark, and Tableau, massive datasets were methodically probed to uncover vital insights. Interactive dashboards revealed high-tipping zones, fee-generating areas, and surcharge-trip duration patterns, empowering stakeholders. Taxi fares were forecasted using predictive modeling approaches that took into account trip characteristics and temporal aspects. This technique made it easier to make educated decisions, optimize taxi services, and evaluate market trends. |
